It's a blog:
- you can register and login
- you can post
- you can comment

The whole thing is developed in Go with Gorilla and HTML templates, with minimal use of JS.
DB is MySQL and it interacts with [mailer_sender](https://github.com/Anacardo89/mailer_sender) through RabbitMQ to send registration emails
It's to show i can do backend :D
